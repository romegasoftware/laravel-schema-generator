<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Basic Installation" label="Basic Installation">

    ### Basic Installation (Laravel only)

    If you're only using Laravel FormRequest classes and don't need Spatie Data support:

    ```bash
    composer require romegasoftware/laravel-schema-generator
    ```

    This provides:

    - âœ… Laravel FormRequest support
    - âœ… Custom validation class support
    - âœ… Basic TypeScript generation
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Spatie Data" label="With Spatie Data">
    ### With Spatie Data Support

    If you want to use Spatie Laravel Data classes:

    ```bash
    composer require spatie/laravel-data
    composer require romegasoftware/laravel-schema-generator
    ```

    This adds:

    - âœ… All basic features
    - âœ… Spatie Data class support
    - âœ… Property-level attribute validation
    - âœ… Data collections and nested objects

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Full Integration" label="Full Integration">
    ### Full Integration

    For the complete feature set including automatic integration with TypeScript transformations:

    ```bash
    composer require spatie/laravel-data
    composer require spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer
    composer require romegasoftware/laravel-schema-generator
    ```

    This provides:

    - âœ… All previous features
    - âœ… Automatic integration with `typescript:transform` command
    - âœ… Coordinated TypeScript type and Zod schema generation

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Package Discovery

Laravel Zod Generator uses **automatic package discovery**, so no manual service provider registration is required. The package will automatically:

- Register the `ZodGeneratorServiceProvider`
- Register the `schema:generate` Artisan command
- Auto-detect installed packages and enable appropriate features

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that everything is working:

```bash
php artisan list | grep zod
```

You should see:

```
schema:generate    Generate Zod schemas from Laravel validation classes
```

You can also check available features:

```bash
php artisan schema:generate --dry-run
```

This will show you which features are available based on your installed packages:

```
ðŸ“¦ Available Features:
  âœ“ Laravel FormRequest support enabled
  âœ“ Spatie Data class support enabled (if installed)
  âœ“ TypeScript Transformer integration available (if installed)
  âœ“ Automatic hook into typescript:transform command available (if installed)
```
